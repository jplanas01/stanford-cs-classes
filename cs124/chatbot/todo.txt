Need 60 points to get perfect score.
-All of starter (30pts)
Order: 1. Movie in quotes recognition
2. Handling non-existant movies and movies with no sentiment attached
3. Sentiment extraction (negation, stemming, ignore words in movie title)
4. Given a cluster of mostly but not exclusively liked movies, suggest more
movies. If only have negative/positive opinion, ask for more until have >3
movies w/ majority liked)
5. Make sure bot sounds relatively fluent, no extraneous output.



-Non-binarized data set (first feature to implement) (4pts)
-Spell checking movie titles (Levenstein distance from input to each title)
(4pts)
-Depend only on first word being capitalized (4pts) (has to be independent of
position of title, only case have to worry about this is when words come after
the title) (check MAX_TITLE_LEN words after first capitalized word)  (4pts).
Only suggest spell checking if distance is below threshold, otherwise fail.
-Disambiguating movie titles with series/year ambiguities (4pts)
-Responding to emotion words (eg, sad, happy, angry) by suggesting a movie
appropriate to said emotion (sad->comedy movie, angry->action movie,
calm->romantic movie, happy->sad drama) (if negation occurs, pretend that they
are feeling the opposite emotion)
-Arbitrary input responses (handling non-movie responses) (4pts)
-Fluency maybe? Depends on what I'd have to handle. Part of above.
-Chatbot! Copy code/reflections, make up responses (hopefully 5+ points)
